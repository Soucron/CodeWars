Write a function reverse which reverses a list (or in clojure's case, any list-like data structure)

(the dedicated builtin(s) functionalities are deactivated)

Solution:

reverse = function(array) {
  let newArr = []
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length;i++) {
    newArr.unshift(array[i])
  }
  return newArr
}
