Task

Given a Divisor and a Bound , Find the largest integer N , Such That ,
Conditions :

    N is divisible by divisor

    N is less than or equal to bound

    N is greater than 0.

Notes

    The parameters (divisor, bound) passed to the function are only positive values .
    It's guaranteed that a divisor is Found .
    
    Solution:
    
  function maxMultiple(divisor, bound){
  let number = 0;
  let array = []
  for (let i = divisor; i <= bound; i++) {
    if (i <= bound && i % divisor == 0) {
      array.unshift(i)
    }
  }
  return array[0]
}
