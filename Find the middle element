The input to the function will be an array of three distinct numbers (Haskell: a tuple).

For example:

gimme([2, 3, 1]) => 0

2 is the number that fits between 1 and 3 and the index of 2 in the input array is 0.

Another example (just to make sure it is clear):

gimme([5, 10, 14]) => 1

10 is the number that fits between 5 and 14 and the index of 10 in the input array is 1.

Solution: 

function gimme (triplet) {
 let arr =[];
  for(let el of triplet ) {
    arr.push(el)
  }
  console.log(arr)
  arr.sort((a,b)=>a-b);
  return triplet.indexOf(arr[1])
}
